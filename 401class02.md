## Notes
### Test Driven Development
1-Unit testing is used to exercise the input, output, and behavior of code.

2-Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think and write tests first.

3-be descriptive with test names. 

4-test file name should be the same as module name.

5-separate test folder from production code and have similar structure.

example:

        mymodule/
        — module.py
        — another_folder/
        — — another_module.py
        tests/
        — test_module.py
        — another_folder/
        — — test_another_module.py

6-Structure of test: AAA - Arrange, Act, Assert

 - Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input).

 -  Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour).

 - Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

7-TDD test cycle:

 - Write a unit test and make it fail.

 - Write the feature and make the test pass.

 - Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one.

8- The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first.


9- Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace.

10- Beginning may be hard — and that’s fine. You just need to practice!

## Recursion

Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself.
The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems and a base condition to stop the recursion.

1- Direct vs Inderect - whether a function calls itself or another function.

2- Tail vs NonTail - considered tail when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function.

3- Recursive programs have greater space requirements than iterative.

Examples:

     # Python code to implement Fibonacci series

     # Function for fibonacci
      def fib(n):

     # Stop condition
      if (n == 0):
      return 0

     # Stop condition
     if (n == 1 or n == 2):
      return 1

     # Recursion function
     else:
     return (fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))


     # Driver Code

     # Initialize variable n.
      n = 5;
     print("Fibonacci series of 5 numbers is :",end=" ")

     # for loop to print the fiboancci series.
      for i in range(0,n):
      print(fib(i),end=" ")
     # Python code to implement Fibonacci series

        # Function for fibonacci
        def fib(n):

        # Stop condition
        if (n == 0):
        return 0

        # Stop condition
        if (n == 1 or n == 2):
        return 1

        # Recursion function
        else:
        return (fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))


        # Driver Code

        # Initialize variable n.
        n = 5;
        print("Fibonacci series of 5 numbers is :",end=" ")

        # for loop to print the fiboancci series.
        for i in range(0,n):
        print(fib(i),end=" ")
