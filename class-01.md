# *Introduction*

It's not that hard to learn how
to write web pages and read
the code used to create them;
you certainly don't have to be a
"programmer."

**Search engine optimization (SEO)** is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.[
### HTML
We will spend the first chapter
looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages. You will see
that you start by writing down
the words you want to appear
on your page. You then add tags
or elements to the words so
that the browser knows what is
a heading, where a paragraph
begins and ends, and so on.**HTML5** is the latest
version of HTML (still under
development at the time of
writing).

### CSS
We start this section with a
chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages. We then go on to
look at the wide variety of CSS
properties you can use in your
CSS rules. These properties
generally fall into one of two
categories:
**Presentation:** How to control
things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages.

**Layout:** How to control where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen.

**different ways in which people access the web
and clarify some terminology:

1- Browsers

2- Web Servers

3- Screen readers

4- Devices


# *CH01 : STRUCTURE*

To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.You can see the **HTML** code for this page below.Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen
is in black.

**The HTML** code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

**Description :**
The opening `<html>` tag indicates that anything between it and a closing `</html>` tag is HTML code.

The `<body>` tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
`</body>` tag should be shown inside the main browser window.

Words between `<h1>` and `</h1>` are a main heading.

**Attributes** provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
