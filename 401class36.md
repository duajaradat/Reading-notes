## Communicate

- communication is key when conducting a WB interview.
- Restate the Question and make sure you fully understand what they're asking you.
- Seek affirmation.

## Ask about Edge Cases

- Don't immediately dive right into coding the solution.
- Think about inputs, expected outputs and potential edge cases
- This shows that you're analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs.
- If the input type is different, what should the function do? 
- Ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

## Write Pseudo code and Ask If it Make Sense

- Think of the logic first, before actually trying to write code.
- Ask if the Pseudo code makes sense... It's possible they'll be more interested in how you think and want to discuss your pseudocode with you.
- If your pseduo code looks good and it logically makes sense, you may not even need to finish the functional code. Being able to reason through the pseudo code is sufficient for many great companies.

## Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

- convert your pseudo code into actual code. 
- Plug in the appropriate code for your language.
- Don't be afraid to ask your interviewer if you forget some syntax or a method name.
