## Notes

- Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to soliving problems, not all about algorithms

- The practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, to make decisions or predictions

- Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

- Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

- Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

- Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

- Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

- Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

- Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

- Two most common categories of task are supervised learning and unsupervised learning

- Supervised learning inclues tasks for "labeled" data

- 3 elements of great machine learning

  - human guidance
  - clean, relevant data
  - avoid overfitting

- 5 core steps
  - Exploratory Analysis
  - Data Cleaning
  - Feature Engineering
  - Algorithm Selection
  - Model Training

***Data Cleaning***

- remove unwanted observation, duplicate & irrelevant observation
- fix structural errors
- filter unwanted outliers
- handle missing data

***Feature Engineering***

- is about creating new input features from existing ones
