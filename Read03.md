## *Wireframe and Design*
**Wireframe** is a schematic useful to help you and your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.

1- know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code.

2- know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

**Example**:

You can draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online.The decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code related to what approach the particular situation requires.It depends largely on how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what is being designed.
**There are a number of ways you can structure the process:**

*Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design.

*Sketch > Code.

*Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code.

*Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code.

**Here are some Online tools you can use them:** 

*UXPin

*InVision

*Wireframe.cc

**How to make your wireframe in six steps**

1. Do your research.

2. Prepare your research for quick reference.

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.

4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.

5. Add some detail and get testing.

6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.


## *HTML basics*
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.**HTML** consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

#### Anatomy of an HTML element

Elements can also have attributes

## Semantics

 Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does runaning that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have"rather than "what does it look like?".

**Semantic elements**
These are some of the roughly  semantic elements available:

1- article

2- asid

3- details

4- figcaption

5- figure

6- footer

7- header

8- main

9- mark

10- nav

11- section

12-summary

13-time
