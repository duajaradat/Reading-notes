## Read / Write files

---

1- The open function can take a second argument

   - 'r' - reading(default)
   - 'w' - writing, truncating(overwriting) the file first -'rb' or 'wb' - open in binary mode(read/write using byte data).

2- There are three different categories of file objects:

3- Text files
Buffered binary files
Raw binary files

```python
files = open('dog_breeds.txt')

try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    files.close()

with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
    # will automatically close the file once it leaves this "with" block
```

**Text File types:**
```python
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
type(file) # TextIOWrapper 
```

**Buffered Binary File Types:** 
```python
file1 = open('abc.txt', 'rb')
file2 = open('abc.txt', 'wb')
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb')
type(file) # io.BufferedReader
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'wb')
type(file) # io.BufferedWriter
```
**Raw File Types:**

```
   file1 = open('abc.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
 file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
    type(file) # io.FileIO
```
**Read Methods:** 
  - .read(size=-1) - reads based on the number os size bytes. No argument, -1, or None reads everything.

  - .readline(size=-1) - reads at most size number of characters from the line.

  - .readlines() - returns a list

```python
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     for line in reader:
>>>         print(line, end='')
```
  - note the end variable is to prevent python from adding a newline to the text that is being printed.

  **Write Methods:**
  - .write(string) >> writes string to the file.
  - .writelines(seq) >> writes the sequence to the file.

  ```python 
  d_path = 'dog_breeds.txt'
  d_r_path = 'dog_breeds_reversed.txt'
  with open(d_path, 'r') as reader, open(d_r_path, 'w') as writer:
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()
    writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))
 ```
## Exceptions

1- Syntax error - occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.

2- Exception error - occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error.

3- Catching Exception hides all errors, so youll want to refer to a specific exception classes you want to catch and handle.

4- else statement will run if no exceptions occur.

5- raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.

6- assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isnâ€™t.

7- In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered. except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.

8- else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.

9- finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
