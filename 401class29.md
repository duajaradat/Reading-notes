# Django Best Practices: Custom User

- Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication.
- always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

## Setup

- create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
- install Django
- make a new Django project called config
- make a new app accounts
- start the local web server

### Commands to run:

- cd ~
- mkdir accounts && cd accounts
- poetry install django
- poetry shell
- django-admin.py startproject config .
- python manage.py startapp accounts
- python manage.py runserver
- note: we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.

## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

- there are two moderm ways to create a custom user model in django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser.

### Custom User Model

- create our initial custom user model requires four steps:
- update `config/settings.py`
- create a new `CustomUser` model
- create new `UserCreation` and `UserChangeForm`
- update the admin

- In `settings.py` we'll add the `accounts` app and use the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` config to tell django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model.
- Within `INSTALLED_APPS` and `account` at the bottom.
- add `AUTH_USER_MODEL = accounts.CustomUser` (add at the bottom of the entire file).
- Update `account/models.py` with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

from django.contrib.auth.models import
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here
```python
    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```
## Superuser

- its helpful to create a SU that we can user to log in to the admin and test out log in/out. 
- `python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Templates/Views/URLs

- update the `settings.py` file.
- TEMPLATES = [{ 'DIRS': [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates'))]}
]
- set the redirect links for log-in/out, both go to our `home` template. Add these two lines of code to the bottom on the file.
- `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'`
- `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'`

- create a new project level template folder and within it a `registration folder` as that's where django will look for the log in template. Add the `singup.html` in there as well.
- `mkdir templates`
- `mkdir templates/registration`

### create the four templates

- `touch templates/registration/login.html`
- `touch templates/registration/sigup.html`
- `touch templates/base.html`
- `touch templates/home.html`


### Update `urls.py` file at the project and app level

      from django.contrib import admin
      from django.urls import path, include
      from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView

      urlpatterns = [
          path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='home.html'), name='home'),
          path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
          path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
          path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
      ]

      - create a `urls.py` file in `accounts` app.
      - touch acccounts/urls.py
      - add the followinig code:
      from django.urls import path
      from .views import SignUpView

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('signup/', SignUpView.as_view(), name='signup'),
]
```
### update `views.py` file in the `accounts` app

```python
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView

from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm


class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = CustomUserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name = 'registration/signup.html'
```
