# React

## conditional Rendering

- use conditional rendering, similar to JS operators like if or the codional operator to create elements representing the current state, React updates the UI to match them

## Element Variables

- use variables to store elements.
- helps you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn't change.

## Inline If with Logical && Operator

- embed expression in JSX by wrapping them in {}.
- Includes logical && operator
- `true && expression` always evaluates to expression, and `false && expression` always evaluates to false.
- If condition if true, the element right after the && will appear in the output. If flase, React will ignore and skip it.

## List and Keys

- use map() function to taek an array of `numbers` and double their values.
const number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doulbed = number.map((number => number * 2)):
console.log(doubled);

## Rendering Multiple Compenents

- build collections of elements and include them in JSX using {}
- loop through the `numbers` array using the JS map() function. Return `<li>` element for each item.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    `<li>{ number }</li>`
);

## Basic List Component

- Key is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.
- assign a `key` to our list items inside `numbers.map()` and fix missing key issue.

### Keys

- keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
- best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.
```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
        {number}
    </li>
);
```
## Forms

### Controlled Components

- form elements such a `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintains their own state and updates it based on user input.
- mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`
- An input form element whose value is controlled by React is called a "controlled componenet"

### The textarea Tag

- In HTML, a `<textarea>` element defines its texst by its children.
- `<textarea>` uses a `value` attribute instead.
- `<textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}>`

### The select Tag

- In HTML, a `<select>` creates a drop-down list.

```jsx
<select value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChage}>
    <option value="grapefruit>Grapefruit</option>
    <option value="lime">Lime</optoin>
</select>
```
## Composition vs Inheritance

### Containment

- use composition instead on inheritance to reuse code between components.
- some components don't know their children ahead of time, such at `Sidebar` or `Dialog`
- use speacial `children` prop to pass children elements directly into their output:
```jsx
function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
