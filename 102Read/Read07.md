# *Expressions and operators*
## [Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)
JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.

For Example: `3+4 or x*y.`.

A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.

For Example: `x++ or ++x`.

*There are many types of operators:*

1- Assignment operators.

2- Comparison operators.

3- Arithmetic operators.

4- Bitwise operators.

5- Logical operators.

6- String operators

7- Conditional (ternary) operator

8- Comma operator

9- Unary operators

10- Relational operators

## [function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Consists of the function keyword, followed by:

*The name of the function.


*A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.


*The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.


## [Control flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

For Example : `if (field==empty) {`

   ` promptUser();`

`} else {`

   ` submitForm();`

`}`
