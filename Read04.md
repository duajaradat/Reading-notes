## *CSS*
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

*CSS* describes how HTML elements should be displayed.*CSS* is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.**CSS** is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group

For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."


`h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}`
 
 CSS, the language is broken down into modules like `background-color`

 ## *How To Add CSS*

 1- **External CSS**
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

For Example : `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">`

2- **Internal CSS**
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

For Example : 
`<style>
body {background-color: linen;}`
`</style>`

3- **Inline CSS** An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

For Example : `<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>`

## *CSS color Property*

The color property specifies the color of text.

**Tip**: Use a background color combined with a text color that makes the text easy to read.
For Example : `body {color: red;}`

`h1 {color: #00ff00;}`
