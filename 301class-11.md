## What is OAuth

**1-What is OAuth?**

An open stander framework that allows users to use SSO across a range of sites and services.

**2-Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**

Going to login to a website and you are given the option to logging in or signing up with Gmail , facebook ,etc.

**3-How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

The following happens (greatly simplified):

The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

**4-What is OpenID?**

It's another security technology that as the site puts it. for humans logging .



## Authorization and Authentication flows

**1-What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

Authentication is verifying who the use actually is . it's vertifying the content that the authenticated person has access to.

**2-What is Authorization Code Flow?**

Essentially the steps taken from user login to the user getting the information requested. It exchanges an authorization code for a token.

**3-What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

A way of using ACF with mobile app or SPA.

**4-What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

IFwFP is used for public clients, or situations where the clients secret is unable to be stored securely.

**5-What is Client Credentials Flow?**

This is used for apps where communication is between two machines. in these intances, entering a username or password wouldn't make sense of to be done by the user .

**6-What is Device Authorization Flow?**

Device authorization flow is used for devices where user input would make for a poor experience. instead, users are asked to go to a website on their phone or computer and enter their info that way.
