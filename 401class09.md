### Dunder Methods

Dunder Methods , special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes,hey start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.


Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call **len('string')**. But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box:

```python
class NoLenSupport:
    pass

>>> obj = NoLenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
TypeError: "object of type 'NoLenSupport' has no len()"

```
To fix this problem , use :

```python
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42
```

Also , You can implement a __getitem__ method which allows you to use Python’s list slicing syntax: obj[start:stop].

- Object Initialization: __init__

- Object Representation: __str__, __repr__

        - __repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

        - __str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

***If you wanted to implement just one of these to-string methods on a Python class, make sure it’s __repr__.***

### Statistics - Probability

**Probability** is a number that reflects the chance or likelihood that a particular event will occur


**Statistics** is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data.

**Understanding Descriptive Statistics** 

Descriptive statistics is about describing and summarizing data. It uses two main approaches:

- The quantitative approach describes and summarizes data numerically.

- The visual approach illustrates data with charts, plots, histograms, and other graphs.

### Choosing Python Statistics Libraries

There are many Python statistics libraries out there for you to work with,some of the most popular and widely used ones:

Python’s statistics is a built-in Python library for descriptive statistics. You can use it if your datasets are not too large or if you can’t rely on importing other libraries.

**NumPy** is a third-party library for numerical computing, optimized for working with single- and multi-dimensional arrays. Its primary type is the array type called ndarray. This library contains many routines for statistical analysis.

**SciPy** is a third-party library for scientific computing based on NumPy. It offers additional functionality compared to NumPy, including scipy.stats for statistical analysis.

**Pandas** is a third-party library for numerical computing based on NumPy. It excels in handling labeled one-dimensional (1D) data with Series objects and two-dimensional (2D) data with DataFrame objects.

**Matplotlib** is a third-party library for data visualization. It works well in combination with NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas.

Note that, in many cases, Series and DataFrame objects can be used in place of NumPy arrays. Often, you might just pass them to a NumPy or SciPy statistical function. In addition, you can get the unlabeled data from a Series or DataFrame as a np.ndarray object by calling .values or .to_numpy().
