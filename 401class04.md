## Thinking Recursively

- A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

- This means a function will continue to call itself until a base condition is met to return a result.

- There's two ways to pass a state through a recursive function:

    1- Threading, which is passing the updated state through the function call as an argument.

    2- Utilizing global variables that get manipulated on each call(not preferred).

## Pytest fixtures and Coverage

- Fixtures - Objects with data that need to be available to multiple tests, or data involving the network or filesytem.

- Coverage:

  1- look into package called pytest-cov.

  2- invoke pytest with --cov option.

  3- example:
  ```python
   pytest --cov=mymul
  ```
  4- coverage html - this creates a directory called htmlcov, open the index.html using your browser, and youll get a web based report.
