# Hashtables

### What is a Hashtable?

1. Hash - A HT is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it's used to determine the index of the array.
2. Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
3. Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same locaiton of the hashtable.

### Why do we use them?

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Libarary

### What Are they

- HT are data structures that utilize key/value pairs. This means that every `Node` or `Bucket` has both a key and a value.
- A `hash` is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.
- Lookup time for a HT has `O(1)` time complexity.
- Instead of adding elements to an array from beginning to end, a hash map uses a "hash function" to place each item at a precise index location, based off it's key.

## Structure

### Hashing

- Hash code turns a key inot an interger.
- Hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input.
- Hash codes should never have randomness to them. They same key should always produce the same hash code.

### Creating a Hash

- A hashtabel traditionally is created from an array. 
- 1024 is a good size to use- this is important for index placement.
1. Add or multiply all the ASCII value together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the raminader of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4. Insert into the array at that index.

## Example:

Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16.

- Each index of the array contain "buckets". Each of these "buckets" holds one key/value pair combination.
- When there is no entry in a specific bucket, the buckets (each index of the array) all start `null`.
- The HT starts each bucket empty and overwrites their value once a key generates as hashCode that corresponds with an index.

### Collisions

- Collisions occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. 
- A "perfect hash" will never have any collisions.
- Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of teh buckets. Instead of starting them all as `null` we can initialize a `LinkedList` in each one.
- Since different keys can lead to teh same bucket it's important to store the entire key/value pair in the bucket, not just the value.
- Hash maps do this to store values:
    - accepts a key
    - calculate the hash of the key
    - use modulus to convert the hash inot an array index.
    - store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list.

- Hash maps do this to read value:
    - accept a key
    - calculate the hash of the key
    - use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
    - use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket.
    - search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given.

## Bucket Sizes

- Hash maps can have any size of buckets.
- If a has map has only a few buckets ti will be densely full and have many collisions. 
- If a hash map has more buckets it will be more sparsely populated, there will be less collisions, but there may be a lot of extra space.

### Recognize

- calculating load factors and choosing the optimal number of buckets, and determining the best hash functions is not within scope of this class.

### Internal Methods

- Add() When adding new key/value pair to a hashtable
    1. send the key to the `GetHash` method.
    2. once you determine the index of where it should be placed, go to that index
    3. check if something exists at that index already, if it doesn't, add it with the key/value pair
    4. if somethign does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket.

- Find() take in a key, gets the Hash, and goes to the index location specified. Once index location is found in the array, iterate through the bucket and see if the key exists and return the value.

- Contains() this method will accept a key, and return a boolean on if that key exists inside the hashtable. The best way to do this is to have the contains call the `GetHash` and check the HT if the key exists in teh table given the index returned.

- GetHash() accpets a key as a stirng, conduct the hash, and then return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed.
