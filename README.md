# _GROWTH MINDSET_
####  Growth Mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities and talents are things that you can improve through practicing  and efforts.On the other hand, Fixed mindset is based on the belief that your abilities , intelligence and etc are static and unchangeable (You’re born with what you’re born with—and that’s it).


### *How to be professinal in work and to avoid the fixed mindsets
|        | **Growth Mindset** | **Fixed Mindset** |
| :------| :------------: | ------------: |
|  **Challenges** | if you face a problem in coding as example and you cannot solve it , look for new ways,methods(think outside the box  until you can move on and remmber to not give up   |avoid the problem and that's it     |
| **Obstacles**   | When you hit a roadblock , divert your attention to somethig else and comeback another time  | Give up easily  |
| **Efforts**  | See efforts that you make as the path or way to be professional | See efforts as worse |
| **Criticism**   | when you review your day and how you've done, let you more organized and help you internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward  | just ignore it and make the days looks like each others |

### * These are some tIPS I do to keep myself in a Growth Mindset:

##### 1- Stop seeking approval from others I always remind myself that "You are the only person who will always be there for you in your life so you are the only one you need to impress."
##### 2- "NOT YET" is OK If you stick with somethig, time and practice will lead to improvement.
##### 3- Speed is not important.
##### 4- Be realistic It takes time, sometimes lots of time.
##### 5- Redefine "genius".
