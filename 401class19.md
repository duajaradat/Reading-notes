## Python Regular Expressions

The use regular expressions in a Pyhton script, it is first necessary to `import re`.

---

### Basic Patterns

Programmers can easily tackle many basic patterns in Python using ordinary characters. Ordinary characters are the simplest regular expressions. They match themselves exactly and do not have a special meaning in their regular expression syntax.

Examples are 'A', 'a', 'X', '5'.

Ordinary characters can be used to perform simple exact matches. Most alphabets and characters will match themselves. For example:

```python
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")
```

The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None.

Notice the r at the start of the pattern Cookie. This is called a raw string literal. It changes how the string literal is interpreted. Such literals are stored as they appear. For example, \ is just a backslash when prefixed with an r rather than being interpreted as an escape sequence. Sometimes, the syntax involves backslash-escaped characters, and to prevent these characters from being interpreted as escape sequences; the raw r prefix is used.

### Special Characters

Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression. For simple understanding, they can be thought of as reserved metacharacters that denote something else and not what they look like.

- `.` - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
- `^` - A caret. Matches the start of the string.
- `$` - Matches the end of string.
- `[abc]` - Matches a or b or c.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9]` - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).
- `\` - Backslash has a few functions:
  - If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken.
  - Otherwise, if the character following the \ is not a recognized escape character, then the \ is treated like any other character and passed through.
  - \ can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning.
- `+` - Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position.
- `*` - Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times starting from that position.
- `?` - Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time starting from that position.
- `{ }` -	Checks for an explicit number of times.
- `( )` -	Creates a group when performing matches.
- `< >` -	Creates a named group when performing matches.

## shutil — High-level File Operations¶

The shutil module includes high-level file operations such as copying and archiving.

---

### Copying Files

copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

```python
import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
```



---

### Working With Directory Trees

shutil includes three functions for working with directory trees. To copy a directory from one place to another, use copytree(). It recurses through the source directory tree, copying files to the destination. The destination directory must not exist in advance.

---

### Finding Files

The which() function scans a search path looking for a named file. The typical use case is to find an executable program on the shell’s search path defined in the environment variable PATH.

```python
import shutil

print(shutil.which('virtualenv'))
print(shutil.which('tox'))
print(shutil.which('no-such-program'))
```

which() takes arguments to filter based on the permissions the file has, and the search path to examine. The path argument defaults to os.environ('PATH'), but can be any string containing directory names separated by os.pathsep. The mode argument should be a bitmask matching the permissions of the file. By default the mask looks for executable files, but the following example uses a readable bitmask and an alternate search path to find a configuration file.

---

### Archives

Python’s standard library includes many modules for managing archive files such as tarfile and zipfile. There are also several higher-level functions for creating and extracting archives in shutil. get_archive_formats() returns a sequence of names and descriptions for formats supported on the current system.

```
import shutil

for format, description in shutil.get_archive_formats():
    print('{:<5}: {}'.format(format, description))
```

Use make_archive() to create a new archive file. Its inputs are designed to best support archiving an entire directory and all of its contents, recursively. By default it uses the current working directory, so that all of the files and subdirectories appear at the top level of the archive. To change that behavior, use the root_dir argument to move to a new relative position on the filesystem and the base_dir argument to specify a directory to add to the archive.

```python
import logging
import shutil
import sys
import tarfile

logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(message)s',
    stream=sys.stdout,
    level=logging.DEBUG,
)
logger = logging.getLogger('pymotw')

print('Creating archive:')
shutil.make_archive(
    'example', 'gztar',
    root_dir='..',
    base_dir='shutil',
    logger=logger,
)

print('\nArchive contents:')
with tarfile.open('example.tar.gz', 'r') as t:
    for n in t.getnames():
        print(n)
```

shutil maintains a registry of formats that can be unpacked on the current system, accessible via get_unpack_formats().

```python
import shutil

for format, exts, description in shutil.get_unpack_formats():
    print('{:<5}: {}, names ending in {}'.format(
        format, description, exts))
```

Extract the archive with unpack_archive(), passing the archive file name and optionally the directory where it should be extracted. If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

```python
import pathlib
import shutil
import sys
import tempfile

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
    print('Unpacking archive:')
    shutil.unpack_archive(
        'example.tar.gz',
        extract_dir=d,
    )

    print('\nCreated:')
    prefix_len = len(d) + 1
    for extracted in pathlib.Path(d).rglob('*'):
        print(str(extracted)[prefix_len:])
```
---

### File System Space

It can be useful to examine the local file system to see how much space is available before performing a long running operation that may exhaust that space. disk_usage() returns a tuple with the total space, the amount currently being used, and the amount remaining free.

```python
import shutil

total_b, used_b, free_b = shutil.disk_usage('.')

gib = 2 ** 30  # GiB == gibibyte
gb = 10 ** 9   # GB == gigabyte

print('Total: {:6.2f} GB  {:6.2f} GiB'.format(
    total_b / gb, total_b / gib))
print('Used : {:6.2f} GB  {:6.2f} GiB'.format(
    used_b / gb, used_b / gib))
print('Free : {:6.2f} GB  {:6.2f} GiB'.format(
    free_b / gb, free_b / gib))
```
