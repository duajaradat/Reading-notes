# Next.js - Dynamic Routes

- Next.js alllows you to statically generate pages with paths that depend on external data.
- enables dynamic URLs in Next.js

### How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Rountes

- Create dynamic rountes for a blog posts:
- each path to have the path `/posts/<id>`, where `<id>` is the name of the markdown file under the top-level directory.
- `ssg-ssr.md` and `pre-rendering.md`, we'd like the paths to be `/posts/ssg-ssr` and `/posts/pre-rendering`

### Overview of the Step

- Create a pages call `[id].js` under `pages/posts`.
- pages that being with `[` and end with `]` are dynamic routes in Next.js
- In `pages/posts/[id].js` write code taht will render a post page
- `getStaticProps` fetch necessary data for the blog post with a given `id`
- `getStaticProps` is given `params` which contain `id` b/c the file name is `[id].js`

### Implement getStaticPaths

- create a file called `[id].js` inside the `pages/posts` directory
- remove `first-post.js` inside the `pages/posts` directory.

## Render Markdown

- use `remark` library to render the markdown content.
- `import remark from 'remark'`
- `import html from 'remark-html'`

## Deploy Next.js App

- Push Next.js app to Github.
- Create a new repo on github
- repo can be public of private. You do not need to initialize it with a README or other files.
- Initialized the git repository locally for you Next.js app.
- Push the Next.js app to your github repo
- To push to Github, run the following commands(replace `<username>` with your Github username):
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/nextjs-blog.git
git push -u origin main

### Deploy to Vercel

- Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.
- easy for frontend teams to develop, preview and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default.

### Create a Vercel Account

- go to https://vercel.com/signup to create a Vercel account. Choose continue wutih Github and go through the sing up process.
- import your `nexstjs-blog` repository on Vercel.
- need to install Vercel for Github and give it access to All repos
- Once you install Vercel, import `nextjs-blog`
- Vercel automatically detect that you have a Next.js app and chooses the optimal build settings for you.

### Next.js and Vercel

- Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js.
- When you deploy the following happens by default
    - pages that use Static Generation and assets will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network
    - pages that use Server-side Rendering and API routnes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions.
