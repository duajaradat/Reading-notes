## Common Terminology

- Node - A tree node is a component which may contain it's own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - root is the node at the beginning of the tree.
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.
- Right - A reference to the other child node in a binary tree.
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from teh root to the furthest leaf.

## Traversals

- Traversing a tree allows us to seach for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more. There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees: Depth First, Breadth First.

### Depth First

- Prioritize going through the depth (heigth) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the `root`.
- Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`
- In-order: `left >> root >> right`
- Post-order: `left >> right >> root`
- The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion, which relies on teh call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reaches the end of a sub-path.

### Pre-order

- means the `root` has to be looked at first.
- When we look at `root.value` first, it means that we output its value. When we call `preOrder` for the first time, the `root` will be added to the call stack.
- Next we check if the `root` has a `left` node set, if so, then send the `left` node to our preOrder method recursively and that `node` becomes the new `root`. 
- The process continues until we reach a leave `node` (bottom of the tree). If the leave node doesn't have a `root.left` or `root.right`, both will return `null` and will end the execution of that method call.
- When it compeletes a function call, we pop it off the stack and are able to continue execution through thte previous function call.
- Code block picks up at the previous root node and check `root.right`, and so-on.

### Traversal Pseudocode

- Pre-order
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- pre-order output of tree node's values

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.left is not Null
        preOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        preOrder(root.right)

- In-order
ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)

- Post-order
ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

### Breadth First

- iterates through the tree by going through each level of teh tree node-by-node.
- Uses a queue(instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.
- Put `root` nodd into the front of the queue.
- Now that we have one node in our queue, we can `dequeue` it and use that node in our code.
- From our `dequeued` node `A`, we can `enqueue` the `left` and `right` child( in that order).
- node `B` becomes front and node `C` becomes `node.next`.
- `dequeue` node `B` and `enqueue` node `D` and `E`.
- Node that `C` is first node, repeat the `dequeue + enqueue` children process. 
- Once we reach a node that doesn't have any children, we just `dequeue` it without any further `enqueue`.

### Binary Tree Vs K-ary Tress

- Trees have a number of children per node, but Binary trees restrict the number of children to two (`left` and `right` children).
- There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added whever space allows them.

#### K-ary Trees

- when nodes are able to have more than 2 child nodes.
- In this type of tree we use `K` to refer to the max number of children that each Node is able to have.
- Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth frist traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down the list od children of lenght k, instead of check for the presence of a left and right child.
- Add `root` node to `queue`, and as long as we have a node in our queue, we can `dequeue`.
- Every `node` we dequeueu, check list of children and `enqueue` each node.
- `dequeue` B and enque it's children.
- rinse and repeat.

### Pseudocode

-ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    for child in front.children
        breadth.enqueue(child)

### Big O
- Time complexity for inserting a new node is `O(n)`.
- Searching for a specific ndoe will also be `O(n)`. 
- Space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first will be `O(w)`, where `w` is the largest width of the tree.
- A perfect binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. The max width for a perfect binary tree is `2^(h-1)`, where `h` is the height of the tree.
- Height can be calculated as `log n`, where `n` is the number of nodes.

### Binary Search Trees

- BST - is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. Nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the `root` are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the `root` are placed to the right.
- Compare to node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree, if the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If larger, only search the right side.
- The best approach for a BST search is with a `while` loop: cycle through the while loop unti you hit a leaf, or until we match our value.
